# Setup Monitoring for Kubernetes

This project aims to provide a monitoring solution designed to provide real-time insights into the performance and health of your Kubernetes cluster. It leverages Prometheus and Grafana to offer a powerful monitoring stack that enables you to:

• Collect and store essential metrics from your Kubernetes infrastructure.

• Visualize data through dynamic dashboards and charts.

• Gives possibility to setup alerts and notifications for critical events if neccesary.

• Gain deep insights into the resource utilization, application behavior, and system health of your Kubernetes environment.

• With Prometheus and Grafana, you can ensure the reliability and efficiency of your Kubernetes deployments by proactively identifying issues, optimizing resources, and making data-driven decisions.
